Claude’s Plan


before that...my plan
1. allow multiple notes to be added to an application





Phase 3: Frontend - Pet Browsing (Livewire Volt)

Pet listing page (/pets) - grid view with photos, filtering by species/breed/age/size/gender, search by name
Pet detail page (/pets/{slug}) - full info, photo gallery, "Apply to Adopt" button (requires auth)
Update navigation to include pet browsing

Phase 4: Frontend - Adoption Applications

Application form page (authenticated) - comprehensive form following interview workflow
User dashboard enhancement - "My Applications" section showing status, interview details
Email notifications for application status changes
Interview scheduling confirmation emails

Phase 5: Testing & Polish

Feature tests for pet browsing (public access)
Feature tests for application submission (authenticated)
