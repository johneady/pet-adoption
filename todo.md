# Todo 👷

## Relelase 1 ✨

* use the site logo and the favicon fields in the setting table.

* fix the n+1 error on the /admin/draws page

* full email testing

* if a species or breed is deleted, add preventative logic if there is an existing pet using those entries.


## Release 2 ⚡

* The intake date on the pet form is still using the native datepicker. Fix that

I will perform a artisan migrate:fresh --seed once you are completed.
